#coderefactor

The main goal of this homework assignement was to refactor the code of an already existing site to make it more accessible - without modifying the actual look of the front-end site.

The main modifications that I made to the refactored HTML/CSS code are:

* Reduced the amount of div elements listed in the HTML code
* Improved the semantic layout of the code in the HTML code
* Added alt source text to all images linked within the HTML code
* Re-named any applicable CSS selectors to apply to the new refactored HTML code
* Debugged a minor image tag errror in the HTML code
